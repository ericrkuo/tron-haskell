Our project, Tron, will be a recreation of the [Tron Light Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)) game. The objective is to force enemy light cycles into walls and jet trails, while also avoiding them. The winner of the game is the last person standing.

This project is in fulfillment of the [CPSC 312 2021W1 project requirements](https://steven-wolfman.github.io/cpsc-312-website/project.html).
